# IP Auditor

The IP Auditor looks through your Apache vhosts to compile a list of apps on the server, what domains are being listened for and what IP each domain is actually pointing to.

This allows you to quickly track which domains and apps are active and which are pointing elsewhere.

## Installation

* clone this repo
* cd into the repo
* run `bundle install`

## Usage

To use the Auditor, cd into the cloned repo and run the following command:

	ruby ./lib/ip_auditor.rb [server name/IP] [user] [options]

Example:

	ruby ./lib/ip_auditor.rb someserver.com myuser

## Output

The Auditor will return a crude report for each VirtualHost in the following format.

	============
	/path/to/vhost/vhostname: <VirtualHost  [IP]:[port]>
	============
	[domain-1]
	[IP domain-1 is actually pointing to]
	[domain-2]
	[IP domain-2 is actually pointing to]
	[/path/to/app/DocumentRoot]

## Options

* -p [PORT NUMBER] : Specify a port number (default is 22)
* -c [FILE NAME (optional)]: Output to .csv file instead of terminal (can specify a name)
* -v : Output more information as to what's happening
* -e [prod|stage|dev|etc.]: Specify an environment to output (defaults to 'all'; determined by passenger config files, so non-rails site will always return)

## TODO

* release as a Gem (currently you have to clone repo and run ruby script)
