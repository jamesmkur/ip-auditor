# IP Auditor

The IP Auditor looks through your Apache vhosts to compile a list of apps on the server, what domains are being listened for and what IP each domain is actually pointing to.

If passenger is installed, it also lists where the rails apps are located and what rvm gemset / rails version they are using.

This allows you to quickly track which domains and apps are active and which are pointing elsewhere. 

## Assumptions

* RVM is installed on the server, and the bin path is /usr/local/rvm/bin/rvm
* Apache vhost files are located in /etc/apache2/site-enabled/
* Apache vhost files follow the "site-name.com" convention
* If passenger is installed, site config files are stored in /etc/passenger.d/
* Passenger files follow the "site-name.com.yml" convention

## Installation

	gem install ip_auditor

## Usage

	audit_ips [server name/IP] [user] [options]

## Options

* -p [PORT NUMBER] : Specify a port number
  * default: 22
* -c [FILE NAME (optional)]: Output to .csv file instead of terminal (can specify a name)
* -v : Output more information as to what's happening
* -e [prod|stage|dev|etc.]: Specify an environment to output
  * default: 'all'; determined by passenger config files, so non-rails site will always return

Examples:

	Basic usage:
	audit_ips someserver.com my_user -p 8080

	Print to "IP Audit - someserver.com.csv":
	audit_ips someserver.com my_user -p 8080 -c

	Print to "IP Audit - my audit.csv":
	audit_ips someserver.com my_user -p 8080 -c "my audit"

## Terminal Output

The Auditor will return a crude report for each VirtualHost in the following format.

	============
	[Site Name]
	============
	[Rails Environment]
	[Directory]
	[Gemset]
	[Rails Version]
	[Virtual Host (IP:port)]

	------------
	Site Statuses
	------------
	[domain-1]
	[IP domain-1 is actually pointing to]

	[domain-2]
	[IP domain-2 is actually pointing to]

	etc.

## CSV Output

If the -c flag is set, Auditor will create a .csv file instead of printing data to the terminal.

The csv file will have the following columns:
Site, Environment, Directory, Gemset, Rails Version, Virtual Host, Site Statuses

The Site Statuses column will actually just be the begnning of a list of sites and the IP's they are pointing to.
